Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most interesting ideas in computer science today. 
Two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. 
A generator ("the artist") learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator ("the art critic") learns to tell real images apart from fakes
